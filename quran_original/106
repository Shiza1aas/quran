106. Surah Al-Quraish

In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful

1. (It is a great Grace and Protection from Allah), for the taming of the Quraish,

2. (And with all those Allah's Grace and Protections for their taming, We cause) the (Quraish) caravans to set forth safe in winter (to the south), and in summer (to the north without any fear),

3. So let them worship (Allah) the Lord of this House (the Ka'bah in Makkah).

4. (He) Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.
