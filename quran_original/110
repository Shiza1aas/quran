110. Surah An-Nasr (The Help)

In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful

1. When comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad () against your enemies) and the conquest (of Makkah),

2. And you see that the people enter Allah's religion (Islam) in crowds,

3. So glorify the Praises of your Lord, and ask for His Forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and forgives.
