112. Surah Al-Ikhlaas or At-Tauhid (The Purity)

In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful

1. Say (O Muhammad ()): He is Allah, (the) One.

2. Allah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks).

3. He begets not, nor was He begotten;

4. And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.
