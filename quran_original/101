101. Surah Al-Qari'ah (The Striking Hour)

In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful

1. Al-Qari'ah (the striking Hour i.e. the Day of Resurrection),

2. What is the striking (Hour)?

3. And what will make you know what the striking (Hour) is?

4. It is a Day whereon mankind will be like moths scattered about,

5. And the mountains will be like carded wool,

6. Then as for him whose balance (of good deeds) will be heavy,

7. He will live a pleasant life (in Paradise).

8. But as for him whose balance (of good deeds) will be light,

9. He will have his home in Hawiyah (pit, i.e. Hell).

10. And what will make you know what it is?

11. (It is) a hot blazing Fire!
