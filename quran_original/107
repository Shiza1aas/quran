107. Surah Al-Maa'oon (The Small Kindnesses)

In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful

1. Have you seen him who denies the Recompense?

2. That is he who repulses the orphan (harshly),

3. And urges not the feeding of AlMiskin (the poor),

4. So woe unto those performers of Salat (prayers) (hypocrites),

5. Who delay their Salat (prayer) from their stated fixed times,

6. Those who do good deeds only to be seen (of men),

7. And refuse Al-Ma'un (small kindnesses e.g. salt, sugar, water, etc.).
