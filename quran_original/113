113. Surah Al-Falaq (The Daybreak)

 In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful

1. Say: I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of the daybreak,

2. From the evil of what He has created;

3. And from the evil of the darkening (night) as it comes with its darkness; (or the moon as it sets or goes away).

4. And from the evil of the witchcrafts when they blow in the knots,

5. And from the evil of the envier when he envies.
