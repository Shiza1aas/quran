In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</item>
<item> 
1. The Reality (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)!
</item>
<item> 
2. What is the Reality?
</item>
<item> 
3. And what will make you know what the Reality is?
</item>
<item> 
4. Thamud and 'Ad people denied the Qari'ah [the striking Hour (of Judgement)]!
</item>
<item> 
5. As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the awful cry!
</item>
<item> 
6. And as for 'Ad, they were destroyed by a furious violent wind;
</item>
<item> 
7. Which Allah imposed on them for seven nights and eight days in succession, so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed), as if they were hollow trunks of date-palms!
</item>
<item> 
8. Do you see any remnants of them?
</item>
<item> 
9. And Fir'aun (Pharaoh), and those before him, and the cities overthrown [the towns of the people of [Lout (Lot)] committed sin,
</item>
<item> 
10. And they disobeyed their Lord's Messenger, so He punished them with a strong punishment.
</item>
<item> 
11. Verily! When the water rose beyond its limits [Nuh's (Noah) Flood], We carried you (mankind) in the floating [ship that was constructed by Nuh (Noah)].
</item>
<item> 
12. That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear (person) may (hear and) understand it.
</item>
<item> 
13. Then when the Trumpet will be blown with one blowing (the first one),
</item>
<item> 
14. And the earth and the mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing,
</item>
<item> 
15. Then on that Day shall the (Great) Event befall,
</item>
<item> 
16. And the heaven will split asunder, for that Day it (the heaven will be frail (weak), and torn up,
</item>
<item> 
17. And the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them.
</item>
<item> 
18. That Day shall you be brought to Judgement, not a secret of you will be hidden.
</item>
<item> 
19. Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand will say: Take, read my Record!
</item>
<item> 
20. Surely, I did believe that I shall meet my Account!
</item>
<item> 
21. So he shall be in a life, well-pleasing.
</item>
<item> 
22. In a lofty Paradise,
</item>
<item> 
23. The fruits in bunches whereof will be low and near at hand.
</item>
<item> 
24. Eat and drink at ease for that which you have sent on before you in days past!
</item>
<item> 
25. But as for him who will be given his Record in his left hand, will say: I wish that I had not been given my Record!
</item>
<item> 
26. And that I had never known, how my Account is?
</item>
<item> 
27. I wish, would that it had been my end (death)!
</item>
<item> 
28. My wealth has not availed me,
</item>
<item> 
29. My power and arguments (to defend myself) have gone from me!
</item>
<item> 
30. (It will be said): Seize him and fetter him,
</item>
<item> 
31. Then throw him in the blazing Fire.
</item>
<item> 
32. Then fasten him with a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits!
</item>
<item> 
33. Verily, He used not to believe in Allah, the Most Great,
</item>
<item> 
34. And urged not on the feeding of Al-Miskin (the poor),
</item>
<item> 
35. So no friend has he here this Day,
</item>
<item> 
36. Nor any food except filth from the washing of wounds,
</item>
<item> 
37. None will eat except the Khati'un (sinners, disbelievers, polytheists, etc.).
</item>
<item> 
38. So I swear by whatsoever you see,
</item>
<item> 
39. And by whatsoever you see not,
</item>
<item> 
40. That this is verily the word of an honoured Messenger [i.e. Jibrael (Gabriel) or Muhammad  which he has brought from Allah].
</item>
<item> 
41. It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe!
</item>
<item> 
42. Nor is it the word of a soothsayer (or a foreteller), little is that you remember!
</item>
<item> 
43. This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).
</item>
<item> 
44. And if he (Muhammad ) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah),
</item>
<item> 
45. We surely should have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might),
</item>
<item> 
46. And then certainly should have cut off his life artery (Aorta),
</item>
<item> 
47. And none of you could withhold Us from (punishing) him.
</item>
<item> 
48. And verily, this Qur'an is a Reminder for the Muttaqun (pious - see V.2:2).
</item>
<item> 
49. And verily, We know that there are some among you that belie (this Qur'an). [Tafsir At-Tabari, Vol. 29, Page 68]
</item>
<item> 
50. And indeed it (this Qur'an) will be an anguish for the disbelievers (on the Day of Resurrection).
</item>
<item>

</item>
<item> 
52. So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.
