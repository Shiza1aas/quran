In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</item>
<item> 
1. Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,
</item>
<item> 
2. Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it;
</item>
<item> 
3. And Who has measured (preordainments for each and everything even to be blessed or wretched); then guided (i.e. showed mankind the right as well as wrong paths, and guided the animals to pasture);
</item>
<item> 
4. And Who brings out the pasturage,
</item>
<item> 
5. And then makes it dark stubble.
</item>
<item> 
6. We shall make you to recite (the Qur'an), so you (O Muhammad ()) shall not forget (it),
</item>
<item> 
7. Except what Allah, may will, He knows what is apparent and what is hidden.
</item>
<item> 
8. And We shall make easy for you (O Muhammad ()) the easy way (i.e. the doing of righteous deeds).
</item>
<item> 
9. Therefore remind (men) in case the reminder profits (them).
</item>
<item> 
10. The reminder will be received by him who fears (Allah),
</item>
<item> 
11. But it will be avoided by the wretched,
</item>
<item> 
12. Who will enter the great Fire and made to taste its burning,
</item>
<item> 
13. Wherein he will neither die (to be in rest) nor live (a good living).
</item>
<item> 
14. Indeed whosoever purifies himself (by avoiding polytheism and accepting Islamic Monotheism) shall achieve success,
</item>
<item> 
15. And remembers (glorifies) the Name of his Lord (worships none but Allah), and prays (five compulsory prayers and Nawafil additional prayers).
</item>
<item> 
16. Nay, you prefer the life of this world;
</item>
<item> 
17. Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.
</item>
<item> 
18. Verily! This is in the former Scriptures,
</item>
<item> 
19. The Scriptures of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses).
