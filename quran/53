</item>
<item> 
11. The (Prophet's) heart lied not (in seeing) what he (Muhammad ) saw.
</item>
<item>

</item>
<item> 
13. And indeed he (Muhammad ) saw him [Jibrael (Gabriel)] at a second descent (i.e. another time).

<item> 
32. Those who avoid great sins (see the Qur'an, Verses: 6:152,153) and Al-Fawahish (illegal sexual intercourse, etc.) except the small faults, verily, your Lord is of vast forgiveness. He knows you well when He created you from the earth (Adam), and when you were fetuses in your mothers' wombs. So ascribe not purity to yourselves. He knows best him who fears Allah and keep his duty to Him [i.e. those who are Al-Muttaqun (pious - see V.2:2)].

</item>
<item> 
42. And that to your Lord (Allah) is the End (Return of everything).
</item>
<item> 
43. And that it is He (Allah) Who makes (whom He wills) laugh, and makes (whom He wills) weep;
</item>

</item>
<item>

</item>

<item> 
55. Then which of the Graces of your Lord (O man!) will you doubt.
</item>
<item> 
56. This (Muhammad ) is a warner (Messenger) of the (series of) warners (Messengers) of old .
</item>
<item> 
57. The Day of Resurrection draws near,
</item>
<item> 
58. None besides Allah can avert it, (or advance it, or delay it).
</item>
<item> 
59. Do you then wonder at this recital (the Qur'an)?
</item>
<item> 
60. And you laugh at it and weep not,
</item>
<item> 
61. Wasting your (precious) lifetime in pastime and amusements (singing, etc.).
