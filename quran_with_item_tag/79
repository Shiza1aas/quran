In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</item>
<item> 
1. By those (angels) who pull out (the souls of the disbelievers and the wicked) with great violence;
</item>
<item> 
2. By those (angels) who gently take out (the souls of the believers);
</item>
<item> 
3. And by those that swim along (i.e. angels or planets in their orbits, etc.).
</item>
<item> 
4. And by those that press forward as in a race (i.e. the angels or stars or the horses, etc.).
</item>
<item> 
5. And by those angels who arrange to do the Commands of their Lord, (so verily, you disbelievers will be called to account).
</item>
<item> 
6. On the Day (when the first blowing of the Trumpet is blown), the earth and the mountains will shake violently (and everybody will die),
</item>
<item> 
7. The second blowing of the Trumpet follows it (and everybody will be raised up),
</item>
<item> 
8. (Some) hearts that Day will shake with fear and anxiety.
</item>
<item> 
9. Their eyes cast down.
</item>
<item> 
10. They say: Shall we indeed be returned to (our) former state of life?
</item>
<item> 
11. Even after we are crumbled bones?
</item>
<item> 
12. They say: It would in that case, be a return with loss!
</item>
<item> 
13. But only, it will be a single Zajrah [shout (i.e., the second blowing of the Trumpet)]. (See Verse 37:19).
</item>
<item> 
14. When, behold, they find themselves over the earth alive after their death,
</item>
<item> 
15. Has there come to you the story of Musa (Moses)?
</item>
<item> 
16. When his Lord called him in the sacred valley of Tuwa,
</item>
<item> 
17. Go to Fir'aun (Pharaoh), verily, he has transgressed all bounds (in crimes, sins, polytheism, disbelief, etc.).
</item>
<item> 
18. And say to him: Would you purify yourself (from the sin of disbelief by becoming a believer),
</item>
<item> 
19. And that I guide you to your Lord, so you should fear Him?
</item>
<item> 
20. Then [Musa (Moses)] showed him the great sign (miracles).
</item>
<item> 
21. But [Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] belied and disobeyed;
</item>
<item> 
22. Then he turned his back, striving hard (against Allah).
</item>
<item> 
23. Then he gathered his people and cried aloud,
</item>
<item> 
24. Saying: I am your lord, most high,
</item>
<item> 
25. So Allah, seized him with punishment for his last [i.e. his saying: I am your lord, most high) (see Verse 79:24)] and first [(i.e. his saying, O chiefs! I know not that you have a god other than I (see Verse 28:38)] transgression.
</item>
<item> 
26. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for whosoever fears Allah.
</item>
<item> 
27. Are you more difficult to create, or is the heaven that He constructed?
</item>
<item> 
28. He raised its height, and He has equally ordered it,
</item>
<item> 
29. Its night He covers with darkness, and its forenoon He brings out (with light).
</item>
<item> 
30. And after that He spread the earth;
</item>
<item> 
31. And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture;
</item>
<item> 
32. And the mountains He has fixed firmly;
</item>
<item> 
33. (To be) a provision and benefit for you and your cattle.
</item>
<item> 
34. But when there comes the greatest catastrophe (i.e. the Day of Recompense, etc.),
</item>
<item> 
35. The Day when man shall remember what he strove for,
</item>
<item> 
36. And Hell-fire shall be made apparent in full view for (every) one who sees,
</item>
<item> 
37. Then, for him who Tagha (transgressed all bounds, in disbelief, oppression and evil deeds of disobedience to Allah).
</item>
<item> 
38. And preferred the life of this world (by following his evil desires and lusts),
</item>
<item> 
39. Verily, his abode will be Hell-fire;
</item>
<item> 
40. But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires, and lusts.
</item>
<item> 
41. Verily, Paradise will be his abode.
</item>
<item> 
42. They ask you (O Muhammad ()) about the Hour, - when will be its appointed time?
</item>
<item> 
43. You have no knowledge to say anything about it,
</item>
<item> 
44. To your Lord belongs (the knowledge of) the term thereof?
</item>
<item> 
45. You (O Muhammad ()) are only a warner for those who fear it,
</item>
<item> 
46. The Day they see it, (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an afternoon or a morning.
