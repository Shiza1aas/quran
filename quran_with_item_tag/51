In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</item>
<item> 
1. By (the winds) that scatter dust.
</item>
<item> 
2. And (the clouds) that bear heavy weight of water;
</item>
<item> 
3. And (the ships) that float with ease and gentleness;
</item>
<item> 
4. And those (angels) who distribute (provisions, rain, and other blessings) by (Allah's) Command;-
</item>
<item> 
5. Verily, that which you are promised (i.e. Resurrection in the Hereafter and receiving the reward or punishment of good or bad deeds, etc.) is surely true.
</item>
<item> 
6. And verily, the Recompense is sure to happen.
</item>
<item> 
7. By the heaven full of paths,
</item>
<item> 
8. Certainly, you have different ideas (about Muhammad  and the Qur'an).
</item>
<item> 
9. Turned aside therefrom (i.e. from Muhammad  and the Qur'an) is he who is turned aside (by the Decree and Preordainment ÇáÞÖÇ æÇáÞÏÑ of Allah).
</item>
<item> 
10. Cursed be the liars,
</item>
<item> 
11. Who are under a cover of heedlessness (think not about the gravity of the Hereafter),
</item>
<item> 
12. They ask; When will be the Day of Recompense?
</item>
<item> 
13. (It will be) a Day when they will be tried (i.e. burnt) over the Fire!
</item>
<item> 
14. Taste you your trial (burning)! This is what you used to ask to be hastened!
</item>
<item> 
15. Verily, the Muttaqun (pious - see V.2:2) will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs (in the Paradise),
</item>
<item> 
16. Taking joy in the things which their Lord has given them. Verily, they were before this Muhsinun (good-doers - see V.2:112).
</item>
<item> 
17. They used to sleep but little by night [invoking their Lord (Allah) and praying, with fear and hope].
</item>
<item> 
18. And in the hours before dawn, they were (found) asking (Allah) for forgiveness,
</item>
<item> 
19. And in their properties there was the right of the beggar, and the Mahrum (the poor who does not ask the others) ,
</item>
<item> 
20. And on the earth are signs for those who have Faith with certainty,
</item>
<item> 
21. And also in your ownselves. Will you not then see?
</item>
<item> 
22. And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are promised.
</item>
<item> 
23. Then, by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it is the truth (i.e. what has been promised to you), just as it is the truth that you can speak.
</item>
<item> 
24. Has the story reached you, of the honoured guests [three angels; Jibrael (Gabriel) along with another two] of Ibrahim (Abraham)?
</item>
<item> 
25. When they came in to him, and said, Salam, (peace be upon you)! He answered; Salam, (peace be upon you ), and said: You are a people unknown to me,
</item>
<item> 
26. Then he turned to his household, so brought out a roasted calf [as the property of Ibrahim (Abraham) was mainly cows].
</item>
<item> 
27. And placed it before them, (saying): Will you not eat?
</item>
<item> 
28. Then he conceived a fear of them (when they ate not). They said: Fear not. And they gave him glad tidings of an intelligent son, having knowledge (about Allah and His religion of True Monotheism).
</item>
<item> 
29. Then his wife came forward with a loud voice, she smote her face, and said: A barren old woman!
</item>
<item> 
30. They said: Even so says your Lord. Verily, He is the All-Wise, the All-Knower.
</item>
<item> 
31. [Ibrahim (Abraham)] said: Then for what purpose you have come, O Messengers?
</item>
<item> 
32. They said: We have been sent to a people who are Mujrimun (polytheists, sinners, criminals, disbelievers in Allah);
</item>
<item> 
33. To send down upon them stones of baked clay.
</item>
<item> 
34. Marked by your Lord for the Musrifun (polytheists, criminals, sinners those who trespass Allah's set limits in evil-doings by committing great sins).
</item>
<item> 
35. So We brought out from therein the believers.
</item>
<item> 
36. But We found not there any household of the Muslims except one [i.e. Lout (Lot) and his two daughters].
</item>
<item> 
37. And We have left there a sign (i.e. the place of the Dead Sea , well-known in Palestine) for those who fear the painful torment.
</item>
<item> 
38. And in Musa (Moses) (too, there is a sign). When We sent him to Fir'aun (Pharaoh) with a manifest authority.
</item>
<item> 
39. But [Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] turned away (from Belief in might) along with his hosts, and said: A sorcerer, or a madman.
</item>
<item> 
40. So We took him and his hosts, and dumped them into the sea, while he was to be blamed.
</item>
<item> 
41. And in 'Ad (there is also a sign) when We sent against them the barren wind;
</item>
<item> 
42. It spared nothing that it reached, but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.
</item>
<item> 
43. And in Thamud (there is also a sign), when they were told: Enjoy yourselves for a while!
</item>
<item> 
44. But they insolently defied the Command of their Lord, so the Sa'iqah overtook them while they were looking.
</item>
<item> 
45. Then they were unable to rise up, nor could they help themselves.
</item>
<item> 
46. (So were) the people of Nuh (Noah) before them. Verily, they were a people who were Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).
</item>
<item> 
47. With power did We construct the heaven. Verily, We are Able to extend the vastness of space thereof.
</item>
<item> 
48. And We have spread out the earth, how Excellent Spreader (thereof) are We!
</item>
<item> 
49. And of everything We have created pairs, that you may remember (the Grace of Allah).
</item>
<item> 
50. So flee to Allah (from His Torment to His Mercy Islamic Monotheism), verily, I (Muhammad ) am a plain warner to you from Him.
</item>
<item> 
51. And set not up (or worship) any other ilahan (god) along with Allah [Glorified be He (Alone), Exalted above all that they associate as partners with Him]. Verily, I (Muhammad ) am a plain warner to you from Him.
</item>
<item> 
52. Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them, but they said: A sorcerer or a madman!
</item>
<item> 
53. Have they (the people of the past) transmitted this saying to these (Quraish pagans)? Nay, they are themselves a people transgressing beyond bounds (in disbelief)!
</item>
<item> 
54.  So turn away (O Muhammad ) from them (Quraish pagans) you are not to be blamed (as you have conveyed Allah's Message).
</item>
<item> 
55. And remind (by preaching the Qur'an, O Muhammad ) for verily, the reminding profits the believers.
</item>
<item> 
56. And I (Allah) created not the jinns and humans except they should worship Me (Alone).
</item>
<item> 
57. I seek not any provision from them (i.e. provision for themselves or for My creatures) nor do I ask that they should feed Me (i.e. feed themselves or My creatures).
</item>
<item> 
58. Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong.
</item>
<item> 
59. And verily, for those who do wrong, there is a portion of torment like to the evil portion of torment (which came for) their likes (of old), so let them not ask Me to hasten on!
</item>
<item> 
60. Then, woe to those who disbelieve (in Allah and His Oneness Islamic Monotheism) from (that) their Day which they have been promised (for their punishment).
