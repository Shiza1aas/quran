1. By the night as it envelops;
</item>
<item> 
2. And by the day as it appears in brightness;
</item>
<item> 
3. And by Him Who created male and female;
</item>
<item> 
4. Certainly, your efforts and deeds are diverse (different in aims and purposes);

</item>
<item> 
16. Who denies and turns away.

<item> 
21. He surely will be pleased (when he will enter Paradise).
