In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful

1. When the heaven is split asunder,
</item>
<item> 
2. And listens and obeys its Lord, and it must do so;
</item>
<item> 
3. And when the earth is stretched forth,
</item>
<item> 
4. And has cast out all that was in it and became empty,
</item>
<item> 
5. And listens and obeys its Lord, and it must do so;
</item>
<item> 
6. O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions (good or bad), a sure returning, so you will meet (i.e. the results of your deeds which you did).
</item>
<item> 
7. Then, as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand,
</item>
<item> 
8. He surely will receive an easy reckoning,
</item>
<item> 
9. And will return to his family in joy!
</item>
<item> 
10. But whosoever is given his Record behind his back,
</item>
<item> 
11. He will invoke (his) destruction,
</item>
<item> 
12. And shall enter a blazing Fire, and made to taste its burning.
</item>
<item> 
13. Verily, he was among his people in joy!
</item>
<item> 
14. Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!
</item>
<item> 
15. Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!
</item>
<item> 
16. So I swear by the afterglow of sunset;
</item>
<item> 
17. And by the night and whatever it gathers in its darkness;
</item>
<item> 
18. And by the moon when it is at the full,
</item>
<item> 
19. You shall certainly travel from stage to stage (in this life and in the Hereafter).
</item>
<item> 
20. What is the matter with them, that they believe not?
</item>
<item> 
21. And when the Qur'an is recited to them, they fall not prostrate,
</item>
<item> 
22. Nay, (on the contrary), those who disbelieve, belie (Prophet Muhammad () and whatever he brought, i.e. this Qur'an and Islamic Monotheism, etc.).
</item>
<item> 
23. And Allah knows best what they gather (of good and bad deeds),
</item>
<item> 
24. So announce to them a painful torment.
</item>
<item> 
25. Save those who believe and do righteous good deeds, for them is a reward that will never come to an end (i.e. Paradise).
