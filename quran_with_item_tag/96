In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</item>
<item> 
1. Read! In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists),
</item>
<item> 
2. Has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood).
</item>
<item> 
3. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous,
</item>
<item> 
4. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen [the first person to write was Prophet Idrees (Enoch)],
</item>
<item> 
5. Has taught man that which he knew not.
</item>
<item> 
6. Nay! Verily, man does transgress all bounds (in disbelief and evil deed, etc.).
</item>
<item> 
7. Because he considers himself self-sufficient.
</item>
<item> 
8. Surely! Unto your Lord is the return.
</item>
<item> 
9. Have you (O Muhammad ()) seen him (i.e. Abu Jahl) who prevents,
</item>
<item> 
10. A slave (Muhammad ()) when he prays?
</item>
<item> 
11. Tell me, if he (Muhammad ()) is on the guidance (of Allah)?
</item>
<item> 
12. Or enjoins piety?
</item>
<item> 
13. Tell me if he (the disbeliever, Abu Jahl) denies (the truth, i.e. this Qur'an), and turns away?
</item>
<item> 
14. Knows he not that Allah does see (what he does)?
</item>
<item> 
15. Nay! If he (Abu Jahl) ceases not, We will catch him by the forelock,
</item>
<item> 
16. A lying, sinful forelock!
</item>
<item> 
17. Then, let him call upon his council (of helpers),
</item>
<item> 
18. We will call the guards of Hell (to deal with him)!
</item>
<item> 
19. Nay! (O Muhammad ())! Do not obey him (Abu Jahl). Fall prostrate and draw near to Allah!
