1. By the forenoon (after sun-rise);
</item>
<item> 
2. And by the night when it is still (or darkens);
</item>
<item> 
3. Your Lord (O Muhammad ()) has neither forsaken you nor hated you.
</item>
<item> 
4. And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world).
</item>
<item> 
5. And verily, your Lord will give you (all i.e. good) so that you shall be well-pleased.
</item>
<item> 
6. Did He not find you (O Muhammad ()) an orphan and gave you a refuge?
</item>
<item> 
7. And He found you unaware (of the Qur'an, its legal laws, and Prophethood, etc.) and guided you?
</item>
<item> 
8. And He found you poor, and made you rich (selfsufficient with selfcontentment, etc.)?
</item>
<item> 
9. Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression,
</item>
<item> 
10. And repulse not the beggar;
</item>
<item> 
11. And proclaim the Grace of your Lord (i.e. the Prophethood and all other Graces).
