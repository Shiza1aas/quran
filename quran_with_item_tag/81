1. When the sun Kuwwirat (wound round and lost its light and is overthrown).
</item>
<item> 
2. And when the stars shall fall;
</item>
<item> 
3. And when the mountains shall made to pass away;
</item>
<item> 
4. And when the pregnant she-camels shall be neglected;
</item>
<item> 
5. And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together;
</item>
<item> 
6. And when the seas shall become as blazing Fire or shall overflow;
</item>
<item> 
7. And when the souls shall be joined with their bodies;
</item>
<item> 
8. And when the female (infant) buried alive (as the pagan Arabs used to do) shall be questioned.
</item>
<item> 
9. For what sin she was killed?
</item>
<item> 
10. And when the written pages of deeds (good and bad) of every person shall be laid open;
</item>
<item> 
11. And when the heaven shall be stripped off and taken away from its place;
</item>
<item> 
12. And when Hell-fire shall be kindled to fierce ablaze.
</item>
<item> 
13. And when Paradise shall be brought near,
</item>
<item> 
14. (Then) every person will know what he has brought (of good and evil).
</item>
<item> 
15. So verily, I swear by the planets that recede (i.e. disappear during the day and appear during the night).
</item>
<item> 
16. And by the planets that move swiftly and hide themselves,
</item>
<item> 
17. And by the night as it departs;
</item>
<item> 
18. And by the dawn as it brightens;
</item>
<item> 
19. Verily, this is the Word (this Qur'an brought by) a most honourable messenger [Jibrael (Gabriel), from Allah to the Prophet Muhammad ()].
</item>
<item> 
20. Owner of power, and high rank with (Allah) the Lord of the Throne,
</item>
<item> 
21. Obeyed (by the angels), trustworthy there (in the heavens).
</item>
<item> 
22. And (O people) your companion (Muhammad ()) is not a madman;
</item>
<item> 
23. And indeed he (Muhammad ()) saw him [Jibrael (Gabriel)] in the clear horizon (towards the east).
</item>
<item> 
24. And he (Muhammad ()) withholds not a knowledge of the unseen.
</item>
<item> 
25. And it (the Qur'an) is not the word of the outcast Shaitan (Satan).
</item>
<item> 
26. Then where are you going?
</item>
<item> 
27. Verily, this (the Qur'an) is no less than a Reminder to (all) the 'Alamin (mankind and jinns).
</item>
<item> 
28. To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight,
</item>
<item> 
29. And you will not, unless (it be) that Allah wills, the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).
