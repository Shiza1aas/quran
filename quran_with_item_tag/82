In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful

1. When the heaven is cleft asunder.
</item>
<item> 
2. And when the stars have fallen and scattered;
</item>
<item> 
3. And when the seas are burst forth;
</item>
<item> 
4. And when the graves are turned upside down (and they bring out their contents)
</item>
<item> 
5. (Then) a person will know what he has sent forward and (what he has) left behind (of good or bad deeds).
</item>
<item> 
6. O man! What has made you careless concerning your Lord, the Most Generous?
</item>
<item> 
7. Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion;
</item>
<item> 
8. In whatever form He willed, He put you together.
</item>
<item> 
9. Nay! But you deny the Recompense (reward for good deeds and punishment for evil deeds).
</item>
<item> 
10. But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you,
</item>
<item> 
11. Kiraman (honourable) Katibin writing down (your deeds),
</item>
<item> 
12. They know all that you do.
</item>
<item> 
13. Verily, the Abrar (pious and righteous) will be in delight (Paradise);
</item>
<item> 
14. And verily, the Fujjar (the wicked, disbelievers, sinners and evil-doers) will be in the blazing Fire (Hell),
</item>
<item> 
15. In which they will enter, and taste its burning flame on the Day of Recompense,
</item>
<item> 
16. And they (Al-Fujjar) will not be absent therefrom (i.e. will not go out from the Hell).
</item>
<item> 
17. And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is?
</item>
<item> 
18. Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is?
</item>
<item> 
19. (It will be) the Day when no person shall have power (to do) anything for another, and the Decision, that Day, will be (wholly) with Allah.
