In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</item>
<item> 
1. I swear by the Day of Resurrection;
</item>
<item> 
2. And I swear by the self-reproaching person (a believer).
</item>
<item> 
3. Does man (a disbeliever) think that We shall not assemble his bones?
</item>
<item> 
4. Yes, We are Able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.
</item>
<item> 
5. Nay! (Man denies Resurrection and Reckoning. So) he desires to continue committing sins.
</item>
<item> 
6. He asks: When will be this Day of Resurrection?
</item>
<item> 
7. So, when the sight shall be dazed,
</item>
<item> 
8. And the moon will be eclipsed,
</item>
<item> 
9. And the sun and moon will be joined together (by going one into the other or folded up or deprived of their light, etc.)
</item>
<item> 
10. On that Day man will say: Where (is the refuge) to flee?
</item>
<item> 
11. No! There is no refuge!
</item>
<item> 
12. Unto your Lord (Alone) will be the place of rest that Day.
</item>
<item> 
13. On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward (of his evil or good deeds), and what he left behind (of his good or evil traditions).
</item>
<item> 
14. Nay! Man will be a witness against himself [as his body parts (skin, hands, legs, etc.) will speak about his deeds].
</item>
<item> 
15. Though he may put forth his excuses (to cover his evil deeds).
</item>
<item> 
16. Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur'an, O Muhammad ) to make haste therewith.
</item>
<item> 
17. It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad ) the ability to recite it (the Qur'an),
</item>
<item> 
18. And when We have recited it to you [O Muhammad  through Jibrael (Gabriel)], then follow you its (the Qur'an's) recital.
</item>
<item> 
19. Then it is for Us (Allah) to make it clear to you,
</item>
<item> 
20. Not [as you think, that you (mankind) will not be resurrected and recompensed for your deeds], but (you men) love the present life of this world,
</item>
<item> 
21. And leave (neglect) the Hereafter.
</item>
<item> 
22. Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah (shining and radiant).
</item>
<item> 
23. Looking at their Lord (Allah);
</item>
<item> 
24. And some faces, that Day, will be Basirah (dark, gloomy, frowning, and sad),
</item>
<item> 
25. Thinking that some calamity was about to fall on them;
</item>
<item> 
26. Nay, when (the soul) reaches to the collar bone (i.e. up to the throat in its exit),
</item>
<item> 
27. And it will be said: Who can cure him and save him from death?
</item>
<item> 
28. And he (the dying person) will conclude that it was (the time) of departing (death);
</item>
<item> 
29. And leg will be joined with another leg (shrouded)
</item>
<item> 
30. The drive will be, on that Day, to your Lord (Allah)!
</item>
<item> 
31. So he (the disbeliever) neither believed (in this Qur'an, in the Message of Muhammad ) nor prayed!
</item>
<item> 
32. But on the contrary, he belied (this Qur'an and the Message of Muhammad ) and turned away!
</item>
<item> 
33. Then he walked in full pride to his family admiring himself!
</item>
<item> 
34. Woe to you [O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you!
</item>
<item> 
35. Again, woe to you [O man (disbeliever)]! And then (again) woe to you!
</item>
<item> 
36. Does man think that he will be left Suda [neglected without being punished or rewarded for the obligatory duties enjoined by his Lord (Allah) on him]?
</item>
<item> 
37. Was he not a Nutfah (mixed male and female discharge of semen) poured forth?
</item>
<item> 
38. Then he became an 'Alaqa (a clot); then (Allah) shaped and fashioned (him) in due proportion.
</item>
<item> 
39. And made him in two sexes, male and female.
</item>
<item> 
40. Is not He (Allah Who does that), Able to give life to the dead? (Yes! He is Able to do all things).
