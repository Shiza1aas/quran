In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</item>
<item> 
1. Ta-Sin-Mim.
</item>
<item> 
[These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur'an, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.]
</item>
<item> 
2. These are the Verses of the manifest Book [this Qur'an, which was promised by Allah in the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), makes things clear].
</item>
<item> 
3. It may be that you (O Muhammad ) are going to kill yourself with grief, that they do not become believers [in your Risalah (Messengership) and in your Message of Islamic Monotheism].
</item>
<item> 
4. If We will, We could send down to them from the heaven a sign, to which they would bend their necks in humility.
</item>
<item> 
5. And never comes there unto them a Reminder as a recent revelation from the Most Beneficent (Allah), but they turn away therefrom.
</item>
<item> 
6. So they have indeed denied (the truth - this Qur'an), then the news of what they mocked at, will come to them.
</item>
<item> 
7. Do they not observe the earth, how much of every good kind We cause to grow therein?
</item>
<item> 
8. Verily, in this is an Ayah (proof or sign), yet most of them (polytheists, pagans, etc., who do not believe in Resurrection) are not believers.
</item>
<item> 
9. And verily, your Lord! He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
</item>
<item> 
10. And (remember) when your Lord called Musa (Moses) (saying): Go to the people who are Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doing),
</item>
<item> 
11. The people of Fir'aun (Pharaoh). Will they not fear Allah and become righteous?
</item>
<item> 
12. He said: My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will belie me,
</item>
<item> 
13. And my breast straitens, and my tongue expresses not well. So send for Harun (Aaron) (to come along with me).
</item>
<item> 
14. And they have a charge of crime against me, and I fear they will kill me.
</item>
<item> 
15. Allah said: Nay! Go you both with Our Signs. Verily! We shall be with you, listening.
</item>
<item> 
16. And when you both come to Fir'aun (Pharaoh), say: 'We are the Messengers of the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists),
</item>
<item> 
17. So allow the Children of Israel to go with us.' 
</item>
<item> 
18. [Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] said [to Musa (Moses)]: Did we not bring you up among us as a child? And you did dwell many years of your life with us.
</item>
<item> 
19. And you did your deed, which you did (i.e. the crime of killing a man). And you are one of the ingrates.
</item>
<item> 
20. Musa (Moses) said: I did it then, when I was an ignorant (as regards my Lord and His Message).
</item>
<item> 
21. So I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukman (i.e. religious knowledge, right judgement of the affairs and Prophethood), and appointed me as one of the Messengers.
</item>
<item> 
22. And this is the past favour with which you reproach me, that you have enslaved the Children of Israel.
</item>
<item> 
23. Fir'aun (Pharaoh) said: And what is the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists)?
</item>
<item> 
24. Musa (Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, if you seek to be convinced with certainty.
</item>
<item> 
25. Fir'aun (Pharaoh) said to those around: Do you not hear (what he says)?
</item>
<item> 
26. Musa (Moses) said: Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!
</item>
<item> 
27. Fir'aun (Pharaoh) said: Verily, your Messenger who has been sent to you is a madman!
</item>
<item> 
28. Musa (Moses) said: Lord of the east and the west, and all that is between them, if you did but understand!
</item>
<item> 
29. Fir'aun (Pharaoh) said: If you choose an ilah (god) other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners.
</item>
<item> 
30. Musa (Moses) said: Even if I bring you something manifest (and convincing)?
</item>
<item> 
31. Fir'aun (Pharaoh) said: Bring it forth then, if you are of the truthful!
</item>
<item> 
32. So [Musa (Moses)] threw his stick, and behold, it was a serpent, manifest.
</item>
<item> 
33. And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders!
</item>
<item> 
34. [Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] said to the chiefs around him: Verily! This is indeed a well-versed sorcerer.
</item>
<item> 
35. He wants to drive you out of your land by his sorcery, then what is it your counsel, and what do you command?
</item>
<item> 
36. They said: Put him off and his brother (for a while), and send callers to the cities;
</item>
<item> 
37. To bring up to you every well-versed sorcerer.
</item>
<item> 
38. So the sorcerers were assembled at a fixed time on a day appointed.
</item>
<item> 
39. And it was said to the people: Are you (too) going to assemble?
</item>
<item> 
40. That we may follow the sorcerers [who were on Fir'aun's (Pharaoh) religion of disbelief] if they are the winners.
</item>
<item> 
41. So when the sorcerers arrived, they said to Fir'aun (Pharaoh): Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners?
</item>
<item> 
42. He said: Yes, and you shall then verily be of those brought near (to myself).
</item>
<item> 
43. Musa (Moses) said to them: Throw what you are going to throw!
</item>
<item> 
44. So they threw their ropes and their sticks, and said: By the might of Fir'aun (Pharaoh), it is we who will certainly win!
</item>
<item> 
45. Then Musa (Moses) threw his stick, and behold, it swallowed up all the falsehoods which they showed!
</item>
<item> 
46. And the sorcerers fell down prostrate.
</item>
<item> 
47. Saying: We believe in the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).
</item>
<item> 
48. The Lord of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron).
</item>
<item> 
49. [Fir'aun (Pharaoh)] said: You have believed in him before I give you leave. Surely, he indeed is your chief, who has taught you magic! So verily, you shall come to know. Verily, I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you all.
</item>
<item> 
50. They said: No harm! Surely, to our Lord (Allah) we are to return;
</item>
<item> 
51. Verily! We really hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, as we are the first of the believers [in Musa (Moses) and in the Monotheism which he has brought from Allah].
</item>
<item> 
52. And We inspired Musa (Moses), saying: Take away My slaves by night, verily, you will be pursued.
</item>
<item> 
53. Then Fir'aun (Pharaoh) sent callers to (all) the cities.
</item>
<item> 
54. (Saying): Verily! These indeed are but a small band.
</item>
<item> 
55. And verily, they have done what has enraged us;
</item>
<item> 
56. But we are host all assembled, amply fore-warned.
</item>
<item> 
57. So, We expelled them from gardens and springs,
</item>
<item> 
58. Treasures, and every kind of honourable place.
</item>
<item> 
59. Thus [We turned them (Pharaoh's people) out] and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.
</item>
<item> 
60. So they pursued them at sunrise.
</item>
<item> 
61. And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Musa (Moses) said: We are sure to be overtaken.
</item>
<item> 
62. [Musa (Moses)] said: Nay, verily! With me is my Lord, He will guide me.
</item>
<item> 
63. Then We inspired Musa (Moses) (saying): Strike the sea with your stick. And it parted, and each separate part (of that sea water) became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.
</item>
<item> 
64. Then We brought near the others [Fir'aun's (Pharaoh) party] to that place.
</item>
<item> 
65. And We saved Musa (Moses) and all those with him.
</item>
<item> 
66. Then We drowned the others.
</item>
<item> 
67. Verily! In this is indeed a sign (or a proof), yet most of them are not believers.
</item>
<item> 
68. And verily, your Lord! He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
</item>
<item> 
69. And recite to them the story of Ibrahim (Abraham).
</item>
<item> 
70. When he said to his father and his people: What do you worship?
</item>
<item> 
71. They said: We worship idols, and to them we are ever devoted.
</item>
<item> 
72. He said: Do they hear you, when you call (on them)?
</item>
<item> 
73. Or do they benefit you or do they harm (you)?
</item>
<item> 
74. They said: Nay, but we found our fathers doing so.
</item>
<item> 
75. He said: Do you observe that which you have been worshipping,
</item>
<item> 
76. You and your ancient fathers?
</item>
<item> 
77. Verily! They are enemies to me, save the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists);
</item>
<item> 
78. Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me;
</item>
<item> 
79. And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink.
</item>
<item> 
80. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me;
</item>
<item> 
81. And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life (again);
</item>
<item> 
82. And Who, I hope will forgive me my faults on the Day of Recompense, (the Day of Resurrection),
</item>
<item> 
83. My Lord! Bestow Hukman (religious knowledge, right judgement of the affairs and Prophethood) on me, and join me with the righteous;
</item>
<item> 
84. And grant me an honourable mention in later generations;
</item>
<item> 
85. And make me one of the inheritors of the Paradise of Delight;
</item>
<item> 
86. And forgive my father, verily he is of the erring;
</item>
<item> 
87. And disgrace me not on the Day when (all the creatures) will be resurrected;
</item>
<item> 
88. The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail,
</item>
<item> 
89. Except him who brings to Allah a clean heart [clean from Shirk (polytheism) and Nifaq (hypocrisy)].
</item>
<item> 
90. And Paradise will be brought near to the Muttaqun (pious - see V.2:2).
</item>
<item> 
91. And the (Hell) Fire will be placed in full view of the erring.
</item>
<item> 
92. And it will be said to them: Where are those (the false gods whom you used to set up as rivals with Allah) that you used to worship
</item>
<item> 
93. Instead of Allah? Can they help you or (even) help themselves?
</item>
<item> 
94. Then they will be thrown on their faces into the (Fire), They and the Ghawun (devils, and those who were in error).
</item>
<item> 
95. And the whole hosts of Iblis (Satan) together.
</item>
<item> 
96. They will say while contending therein,
</item>
<item> 
97. By Allah, we were truly in a manifest error,
</item>
<item> 
98. When We held you (false gods) as equals (in worship) with the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists);
</item>
<item> 
99. And none has brought us into error except the Mujrimun [Iblis (Satan) and those of human beings who commit crimes, murderers, polytheists, oppressors, etc.].
</item>
<item> 
100. Now we have no intercessors,
</item>
<item> 
101. Nor a close friend (to help us).
</item>
<item> 
102. (Alas!) If we only had a chance to return (to the world), we shall truly be among the believers!
</item>
<item> 
103. Verily! In this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
</item>
<item> 
104. And verily, your Lord! He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
</item>
<item> 
105. The people of Nuh (Noah) belied the Messengers.
</item>
<item> 
106. When their brother Nuh (Noah) said to them: Will you not fear Allah and obey Him?
</item>
<item> 
107. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.
</item>
<item> 
108. So fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.
</item>
<item> 
109. No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Islamic Monotheism), my reward is only from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).
</item>
<item> 
110. So keep your duty to Allah, fear Him and obey me.
</item>
<item> 
111. They said: Shall we believe in you, when the meanest (of the people) follow you?
</item>
<item> 
112. He said: And what knowledge have I of what they used to do?
</item>
<item> 
113. Their account is only with my Lord, if you could (but) know.
</item>
<item> 
114. And I am not going to drive away the believers.
</item>
<item> 
115. I am only a plain warner.
</item>
<item> 
116. They said: If you cease not, O Nuh (Noah)! You will surely be among those stoned (to death).
</item>
<item> 
117. He said: My Lord! Verily, my people have belied me.
</item>
<item> 
118. Therefore judge You between me and them, and save me and those of the believers who are with me.
</item>
<item> 
119. And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.
</item>
<item> 
120. Then We drowned the rest (disbelievers) thereafter.
</item>
<item> 
121. Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
</item>
<item> 
122. And verily! Your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
</item>
<item> 
123. 'Ad (people) belied the Messengers.
</item>
<item> 
124. When their brother Hud said to them: Will you not fear Allah and obey Him?
</item>
<item> 
125. Verily! I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.
</item>
<item> 
126. So fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.
</item>
<item> 
127. No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Islamic Monotheism), my reward is only from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns, and all that exists).
</item>
<item> 
128. Do you build high palaces on every high place, while you do not live in them?
</item>
<item> 
129. And do you get for yourselves palaces (fine buildings) as if you will live therein for ever.
</item>
<item> 
130. And when you seize, seize you as tyrants?
</item>
<item> 
131. So fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.
</item>
<item> 
132. And keep your duty to Him, fear Him Who has aided you with all (good things) that you know.
</item>
<item> 
133. He has aided you with cattle and children.
</item>
<item> 
134. And gardens and springs.
</item>
<item> 
135. Verily, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.
</item>
<item> 
136. They said: It is the same to us whether you preach or be not of those who preach.
</item>
<item> 
137. This is no other than the false-tales and religion of the ancients, [Tafsir At-Tabari, Vol.19, Page 97]
</item>
<item> 
138. And we are not going to be punished.
</item>
<item> 
139. So they belied him, and We destroyed them. Verily! In this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
</item>
<item> 
140. And verily! Your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
</item>
<item> 
141. Thamud (people) belied the Messenger.
</item>
<item> 
142. When their brother Salih (Saleh) said to them: Will you not fear Allah and obey Him?
</item>
<item> 
143. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.
</item>
<item> 
144. So fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.
</item>
<item> 
145. No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Islamic Monotheism), my reward is only from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).
</item>
<item> 
146. Will you be left secure in that which you have here?
</item>
<item> 
147. In gardens and springs.
</item>
<item> 
148. And green crops (fields etc.) and date-palms with soft spadix.
</item>
<item> 
149. And you carve houses out of mountains with great skill.
</item>
<item> 
150. So fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.
</item>
<item> 
151. And follow not the command of Al-Musrifun [i.e. their chiefs, leaders who were polytheists, criminals and sinners],
</item>
<item> 
152. Who make mischief in the land, and reform not.
</item>
<item> 
153. They said: You are only of those bewitched!
</item>
<item> 
154. You are but a human being like us. Then bring us a sign if you are of the truthful.
</item>
<item> 
155. He said: Here is a she-camel; it has a right to drink (water), and you have a right to drink (water) (each) on a day, known.
</item>
<item> 
156. And touch her not with harm, lest the torment of a Great Day seize you.
</item>
<item> 
157. But they killed her, and then they became regretful.
</item>
<item> 
158. So the torment overtook them. Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
</item>
<item> 
159. And verily! Your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
</item>
<item> 
160. The prople of Lout (Lot) (those dwelt in the towns of Sodom in Palestine) belied the Messengers.
</item>
<item> 
161. When their brother Lout (Lot) said to them: Will you not fear Allah and obey Him?
</item>
<item> 
162. Verily! I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.
</item>
<item> 
163. So fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.
</item>
<item> 
164. No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Islamic Monotheism), my reward is only from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).
</item>
<item> 
165. Go you in unto the males of the 'Alamin (mankind),
</item>
<item> 
166. And leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your wives? Nay, you are a trespassing people!
</item>
<item> 
167. They said: If you cease not. O Lout (Lot)! Verily, you will be one of those who are driven out!
</item>
<item> 
168. He said: I am, indeed, of those who disapprove with severe anger and fury your (this evil) action (of sodomy).
</item>
<item> 
169. My Lord! Save me and my family from what they do.
</item>
<item> 
170. So We saved him and his family, all,
</item>
<item> 
171. Except an old woman (his wife) among those who remained behind.
</item>
<item> 
172. Then afterward We destroyed the others.
</item>
<item> 
173. And We rained on them a rain (of torment). And how evil was the rain of those who had been warned.
</item>
<item> 
174. Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
</item>
<item> 
175. And verily! Your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
</item>
<item> 
176. The dwellers of Al-Aiyka [near Madyan (Midian)] belied the Messengers.
</item>
<item> 
177. When Shu'aib (Shuaib) said to them: Will you not fear Allah (and obey Him)?
</item>
<item> 
178. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.
</item>
<item> 
179. So fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me.
</item>
<item> 
180. No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Islamic Monotheism), my reward is only from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).
</item>
<item> 
181. Give full measure, and cause no loss (to others).
</item>
<item> 
182. And weigh with the true and straight balance.
</item>
<item> 
183. And defraud not people by reducing their things, nor do evil, making corruption and mischief in the land.
</item>
<item> 
184. And fear Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old.
</item>
<item> 
185. They said: You are only one of those bewitched!
</item>
<item> 
186. You are but a human being like us and verily, we think that you are one of the liars!
</item>
<item> 
187. So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!
</item>
<item> 
188. He said: My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.
</item>
<item> 
189. But they belied him, so the torment of the day of shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them, indeed that was the torment of a Great Day.
</item>
<item> 
190. Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers.
</item>
<item> 
191. And verily! Your Lord, He is indeed the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.
</item>
<item> 
192. And truly, this (the Qur'an) is a revelation from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists),
</item>
<item> 
193. Which the trustworthy Ruh [Jibrael (Gabriel)] has brought down;
</item>
<item> 
194. Upon your heart (O Muhammad ) that you may be (one) of the warners,
</item>
<item> 
195. In the plain Arabic language.
</item>
<item> 
196. And verily, it (the Qur'an, and its revelation to Prophet Muhammad ) is (announced) in the Scriptures [i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] of former people.
</item>
<item> 
197. Is it not a sign to them that the learned scholars (like 'Abdullah bin Salam who embraced Islam) of the Children of Israel knew it (as true)?
</item>
<item> 
198. And if We had revealed it (this Qur'an) unto any of the non-Arabs,
</item>
<item> 
199. And he had recited it unto them, they would not have believed in it.
</item>
<item> 
200. Thus have We caused it (the denial of the Qur'an) to enter the hearts of the Mujrimun (criminals, polytheists, sinners, etc.).
</item>
<item> 
201. They will not believe in it until they see the painful torment;
</item>
<item> 
202. It shall come to them of a sudden, while they perceive it not;
</item>
<item> 
203. Then they will say: Can we be respited?
</item>
<item> 
204. Would they then wish for Our Torment to be hastened on?
</item>
<item> 
205. Tell Me, if We do let them enjoy for years,
</item>
<item> 
206. And afterwards comes to them that (punishment) which they had been promised!
</item>
<item> 
207. All that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them.
</item>
<item> 
208. And never did We destroy a township, but it had its warners
</item>
<item> 
209. By way of reminder, and We have never been unjust.
</item>
<item> 
210. And it is not the Shayatin (devils) who have brought it (this Qur'an) down,
</item>
<item> 
211. Neither would it suit them, nor they can (produce it).
</item>
<item> 
212. Verily, they have been removed far from hearing it.
</item>
<item> 
213. So invoke not with Allah another ilah (god) lest you be among those who receive punishment.
</item>
<item> 
214. And warn your tribe (O Muhammad ) of near kindred.
</item>
<item> 
215. And be kind and humble to the believers who follow you.
</item>
<item> 
216. Then if they disobey you, say: I am innocent of what you do.
</item>
<item> 
217. And put your trust in the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful,
