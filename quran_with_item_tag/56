In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</item>
<item> 
1. When the Event (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) befalls.
</item>
<item> 
2. And there can be no denying of its befalling.
</item>
<item> 
3. It will bring low (some); (and others) it will exalt;
</item>
<item> 
4. When the earth will be shaken with a terrible shake.
</item>
<item> 
5. And the mountains will be powdered to dust.
</item>
<item> 
6. So that they will become floating dust particles.
</item>
<item> 
7. And you (all) will be in three kinds (i.e. separate groups).
</item>
<item> 
8. So those on the Right Hand (i.e. those who will be given their Records in their right hands), Who will be those on the Right Hand? (As a respect for them, because they will enter Paradise).
</item>
<item> 
9. And those on the Left Hand (i.e. those who will be given their Record in their left hands), Who will be those on the Left Hand? (As a disgrace for them, because they will enter Hell).
</item>
<item> 
10. And those foremost [(in Islamic Faith of Monotheism and in performing righteous deeds) in the life of this world on the very first call for to embrace Islam,] will be foremost (in Paradise).
</item>
<item> 
11. These will be those nearest to Allah.
</item>
<item> 
12. In the Gardens of delight (Paradise).
</item>
<item> 
13. A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first generations (who embraced Islam).
</item>
<item> 
14. And a few of those (foremost) will be from the later time (generations).
</item>
<item> 
15. (They will be) on thrones woven with gold and precious stones,
</item>
<item> 
16. Reclining thereon, face to face.
</item>
<item> 
17. They will be served by immortal boys,
</item>
<item> 
18. With cups, and jugs, and a glass from the flowing wine,
</item>
<item> 
19. Wherefrom they will get neither any aching of the head, nor any intoxication.
</item>
<item> 
20. And fruit; that they may choose.
</item>
<item> 
21. And the flesh of fowls that they desire.
</item>
<item> 
22. And (there will be) Houris (fair females) with wide, lovely eyes (as wives for the pious),
</item>
<item> 
23. Like unto preserved pearls.
</item>
<item> 
24. A reward for what they used to do.
</item>
<item> 
25. No Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech (like backbiting, etc.).
</item>
<item> 
26. But only the saying of: Salam!, Salam! (greetings with peace) !
</item>
<item> 
27. And those on the Right Hand, - Who will be those on the Right Hand?
</item>
<item> 
28. (They will be) among thornless lote-trees,
</item>
<item> 
29. Among Talh (banana-trees) with fruits piled one above another,
</item>
<item> 
30. In shade long-extended,
</item>
<item> 
31. By water flowing constantly,
</item>
<item> 
32. And fruit in plenty,
</item>
<item> 
33. Whose season is not limited, and their supply will not be cut off,
</item>
<item> 
34. And on couches or thrones, raised high.
</item>
<item> 
35. Verily, We have created them (maidens) of special creation.
</item>
<item> 
36. And made them virgins.
</item>
<item> 
37. Loving (their husbands only), equal in age.
</item>
<item> 
38. For those on the Right Hand.
</item>
<item> 
39. A multitude of those (on the Right Hand) will be from the first generation (who embraced Islam).
</item>
<item> 
40. And a multitude of those (on the Right Hand) will be from the later times (generations).
</item>
<item> 
41. And those on the Left Hand Who will be those on the Left Hand?
</item>
<item> 
42. In fierce hot wind and boiling water,
</item>
<item> 
43. And shadow of black smoke,
</item>
<item> 
44. (That shadow) neither cool, nor (even) good,
</item>
<item> 
45. Verily, before that, they indulged in luxury,
</item>
<item> 
46. And were persisting in great sin (joining partners in worship along with Allah, committing murders and other crimes, etc.)
</item>
<item> 
47. And they used to say: When we die and become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be resurrected?
</item>
<item> 
48. And also our forefathers?
</item>
<item> 
49. Say (O Muhammad ): (Yes) verily, those of old, and those of later times.
</item>
<item> 
50. All will surely be gathered together for appointed Meeting of a known Day.
</item>
<item> 
51. Then moreover, verily, you the erring-ones, the deniers (of Resurrection)!
</item>
<item> 
52. You verily will eat of the trees of Zaqqum.
</item>
<item> 
53. Then you will fill your bellies therewith,
</item>
<item> 
54. And drink boiling water on top of it,
</item>
<item> 
55. So you will drink (that) like thirsty camels!
</item>
<item> 
56. That will be their entertainment on the Day of Recompense!
</item>
<item> 
57. We created you, then why do you believe not?
</item>
<item> 
58. Then tell Me (about) the human semen that you emit.
</item>
<item> 
59. Is it you who create it (i.e. make this semen into a perfect human being), or are We the Creator?
</item>
<item> 
60. We have decreed death to you all, and We are not unable,
</item>
<item> 
61. To transfigure you and create you in (forms) that you know not.
</item>
<item> 
62. And indeed, you have already known the first form of creation (i.e. the creation of Adam), why then do you not remember or take heed?
</item>
<item> 
63. Tell Me! The seed that you sow in the ground.
</item>
<item> 
64. Is it you that make it grow, or are We the Grower?
</item>
<item> 
65. Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry pieces, and you would be regretful (or left in wonderment).
</item>
<item> 
66. (Saying): We are indeed Mughramun (i.e. ruined or lost the money without any profit, or punished by the loss of all that we spend for cultivation, etc.)! [See Tafsir Al-Qurtubi, Vol. 17, Page 219]
</item>
<item> 
67. Nay, but we are deprived!
</item>
<item> 
68. Tell Me! The water that you drink.
</item>
<item> 
69. Is it you who cause it from the rainclouds to come down, or are We the Causer of it to come down?
</item>
<item> 
70. If We willed, We verily could make it salt (and undrinkable), why then do you not give thanks (to Allah)?
</item>
<item> 
71. Tell Me! The fire which you kindle,
</item>
<item> 
72. Is it you who made the tree thereof to grow, or are We the Grower?
</item>
<item> 
73. We have made it a Reminder (for the Hell-fire, in the Hereafter); and an article of use for the travellers (and all the others, in this world).
</item>
<item> 
74. Then glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.
</item>
<item> 
75. So I swear by Mawaqi (setting or the mansions, etc.) of the stars (they traverse).
</item>
<item> 
76. And verily, that is indeed a great oath, if you but know.
</item>
<item> 
77. That (this) is indeed an honourable recital (the Noble Qur'an).
</item>
<item> 
78. In a Book well-guarded (with Allah in the heaven i.e. Al-Lauh Al-Mahfuz).
</item>
<item> 
79. Which (that Book with Allah) none can touch but the purified (i.e. the angels).
</item>
<item> 
80. A Revelation (this Qur'an) from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).
</item>
<item> 
81. Is it such a talk (this Qur'an) that you (disbelievers) deny?
</item>
<item> 
82. And instead (of thanking Allah) for the provision He gives you, on the contrary, you deny Him (by disbelief)!
</item>
<item> 
83. Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of a dying person) reaches the throat?
</item>
<item> 
84. And you at the moment are looking on,
</item>
<item> 
85. But We (i.e. Our angels who take the soul) are nearer to him than you, but you see not, [Tafsir At-Tabari, Vol.27, Page 209]
</item>
<item> 
86. Then why do you not, if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense (punishment, etc.)
</item>
<item> 
87. Bring back the soul (to its body), if you are truthful?
</item>
<item> 
88. Then, if he (the dying person) be of the Muqarrabun (those brought near to Allah),
</item>
<item> 
89. (There is for him) rest and provision, and a Garden of delights (Paradise).
</item>
<item> 
90.  And if he (the dying person) be of those on the Right Hand,
</item>
<item> 
91. Then there is safety and peace (from the Punishment of Allah) for (you as you are from) those on the Right Hand.
</item>
<item> 
92. But if he (the dying person) be of the denying (of the Resurrection), the erring (away from the Right Path of Islamic Monotheism),
</item>
<item> 
93. Then for him is entertainment with boiling water.
</item>
<item> 
94. And burning in Hell-fire.
</item>
<item> 
95. Verily, this! This is an absolute Truth with certainty.
</item>
<item> 
96. So glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.
