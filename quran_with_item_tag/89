In the Name of Allah, The Most Gracious, Most Merciful
</item>
<item> 
1. By the dawn;
</item>
<item> 
2. By the ten nights (i.e. the first ten days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah),
</item>
<item> 
3. And by the even and the odd (of all the creations of Allah).
</item>
<item> 
4. And by the night when it departs.
</item>
<item> 
5. There is indeed in them (the above oaths) sufficient proofs for men of understanding (and that, they should avoid all kinds of sins and disbeliefs, etc.)!
</item>
<item> 
6. Did you (O Muhammad ()) not see (thought) how your Lord dealt with 'Ad (people)?
</item>
<item> 
7. Who were very tall like lofty pillars,
</item>
<item> 
8. The like of which were not created in the land?
</item>
<item> 
9. And (with) Thamud (people), who cut (hewed) out rocks in the valley (to make dwellings)?
</item>
<item> 
10. And (with) Fir'aun (Pharaoh), who had pegs (who used to torture men by binding them to pegs)?
</item>
<item> 
11. Who did transgress beyond bounds in the lands (in the disobedience of Allah).
</item>
<item> 
12. And made therein much mischief.
</item>
<item> 
13. So your Lord poured on them different kinds of severe torment.
</item>
<item> 
14. Verily, your Lord is Ever Watchful (over them).
</item>
<item> 
15. As for man, when his Lord tries him by giving him honour and gifts, then he says (puffed up): My Lord has honoured me.
</item>
<item> 
16. But when He tries him, by straitening his means of life, he says: My Lord has humiliated me!
</item>
<item> 
17. Nay! But you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity (i.e. you neither treat them well, nor give them their exact right of inheritance)!
</item>
<item> 
18. And urge not on the feeding of AlMiskin (the poor)!
</item>
<item> 
19. And you devour inheritance all with greed,
</item>
<item> 
20. And you love wealth with much love!
</item>
<item> 
21. Nay! When the earth is ground to powder,
</item>
<item> 
22. And your Lord comes with the angels in rows,
</item>
<item> 
23. And Hell will be brought near that Day. On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance (then) avail him?
</item>
<item> 
24. He will say: Alas! Would that I had sent forth (good deeds) for (this) my life!
</item>
<item> 
25. So on that Day, none will punish as He will punish.
</item>
<item> 
26. And none will bind as He will bind.
</item>
<item> 
27. (It will be said to the pious): O (you) the one in (complete) rest and satisfaction!
</item>
<item> 
28. Come back to your Lord, Well-pleased (yourself) and well-pleasing unto Him!
</item>
<item> 
29. Enter you, then, among My honoured slaves,
</item>
<item> 
30. And enter you My Paradise!
